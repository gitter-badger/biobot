  bot.say("The standard way to meet the biohackers is to come to the Hackspace Open Evening - every tuesday from 7:30pm. The hackspace Tuesday tour is open to the public, so just come along and join a group. It's a good general introduction for prospective members of the main space, but they will show the biolab and probably talk about some projects going on. There is usually a biohacker in the lab who can answer questions.")
